def icharger208b(source):
    """Parse data from an iCharger 208B battery charger.

    Parses data events emitted by the charger during charge, discharge, etc.
    Likely works with other models from iCharger, but this is untested.
    Consider :ref:`contributing` to let us know.

    This model battery charger comes with a USB cable that provides
    serial-over-USB communication with the host computer.  To connect with the
    charger, you'll need to open a handle to the appropriate serial port, the
    name of which will vary between platforms and based on the number of
    devices currently connected, and feed lines of text to the parser.

    Examples
    --------

    Open a serial port on a Mac OSX computer using `pySerial <http://pyserial.readthedocs.io>`_, read lines from the serial port,
    parse them into records, and print them to stdout:

    >>> pipe = serial.serial_for_url("/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART", baudrate=128000)
    >>> pipe = pipecat.utility.readline(pipe)
    >>> pipe = pipecat.device.charger.icharger208b(pipe)
    >>> for record in pipe:
    ...   print record

    Parameters
    ----------
    source: :ref:`Record generator <record-generators>` returning records containing a "string" field.

    Yields
    ------
    records: dict
        Records will contain information including the charge mode, supply
        voltage, battery voltage, battery current, internal and external
        charger temperature, and the total charged added-to / removed-from the
        battery.
