    """Generate an empty record at fixed time intervals using the host clock.

    Typically, you would use functions such as
    :func:`pipecat.utility.add_field` or :func:`pipecat.utility.add_timestamp`
    to populate the (otherwise empty) records.

    Examples
    --------

    If you want to know what time it is, at 5-minute intervals:

    >>> pipe = pipecat.device.clock.metronome(pipecat.quantity(5, pipecat.units.minutes))
    >>> pipe = pipecat.utility.add_timestamp(pipe)
    >>> for record in pipe:
    ...   print record

    Parameters
    ----------
    rate: time quantity, required
        The amount of time to wait between records.

    Yields
    ------
    record: dict
        Empty record returned at fixed time intervals.
